# Anime

[They don't make anime like they used to](https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations). My favorite era for anime was the OVA era during the 80's and 90's. Shorter episodic runs. Cel animation. [Dimenional noses](https://x.com/axl99/status/1651994155311325184).  More killer, less filler.
